Dissertation proposal is the first step of the formal dissertation process. Starting well is the good indicator of success not just in finishing an academic document but more importantly later career developments. This article gives simple suggestions and general directions of preparing and starting this writing process. Much of these suggestions are based on the author's personal experience as an advisor of graduate studies and from sitting on dissertation committees in different roles.

In general, four steps: planning, research, writing and defense.

# I. Planning

1.  Most Important: Invite your chair
    1.  Build a trust-based relationship with your professors
    2.  Start talking about research with as many professors as possible
    3.  LISTEN for "data collection"
    4.  Write formal invitation
2.  Who is your chair?
    1.  Professor and instructor
    2.  Mentor
    3.  Advisor
    4.  (Coauthor)
    5.  Professional vs. Personal
3.  Schedule regular meetings with chair
    1.  Observe professional etiquette
        1.  Email correspondence
            1.  Appropriate
            2.  Timely
            3.  Regular
        2.  Build professionalism (start thinking of whom you will become, "already but not yet")
    2.  Produce content weekly
    3.  Make in-person meeting

# II. Research

1.  Find a topic
    1.  Start from something small and unnoticed
    2.  Read
    3.  Investigate
2.  Literature
    1.  Database approach vs. memory approach
    2.  Cite, cite smart and cite well
    3.  Take notes, annotation
3.  Scaling
    1.  "Prototype"
    2.  Focus
    3.  Originality         

# III. Writing

1.  MUST WRITE WELL
    -   Personal suggestions (particularly for international students):
        -   Avoid long sentences (KISS)
        -   Avoid personal
            -   e.g. use this study instead of "I"
        -   Use active voice
        -   Pay attention to numbers use nine instead of 9.
    -   Aesthetics: simple, clean, consistent
2.  Unforgivable mistakes
    -   Spelling
    -   Grammar
    -   Missing page numbers
    -   Formatting
    -   In a nutshell, do your own review and revise multiple times 
        -   Don't let your chair frown on your work

# IV. Defense

1.  Do your own paperworks 
    -   It is your responsibility, not your chair's
    -   Know the rules (OGE, EPPS Dean's office)
2.  Leave ample room to committee members to read and advise
    -   Schedule defense only when your proposal is ready or only need minor revisions
    -   Send to committee at least two weeks in advance
    -   Schedule individual meetings with members at least one week in advance to the defense

# V. Next steps forward

-   Meet with chair regularly
-   Produce content weekly
-   Observe OGE deadlines and plan for final oral defense
